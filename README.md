## What is this?

This is something I made in 2017 and I feel like it's alright to share with the world, as the code is outdated for the game (will probably crash), and the techniques (dll injection + user mode hooks) are very known.

I do not condone its use in any way, it was made public for educational purposes.

`Amazing/` is the dll injector, `Package/` is the dll to be injected into the game's process.
